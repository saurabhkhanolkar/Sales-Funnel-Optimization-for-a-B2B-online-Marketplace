We have the contribution of the marketing channels to growth in Dec 2017 and Jan 2018.

Let us compare them and investigate what worked out for the Marketplace.

In order to check if there is significant difference in the proportions, we will perform Hypothesis Testing (One population proportion testing).

Null Hypothesis (n0) : There is no significant change in the proportions of the . Any change observed is purely due to chance.

Alternative Hypothesis (n1) : The change in the Marketing Channel effectiveness is significant and must be investigated.Â¶

Results of the Hypothesis test:

Insights: 
There was a 20% increase (30% to 36%) in the contribution (proportion) of organic searches towards leads generation in the period of growth. This is a **statistically significant result.**

The other Channels either decreased in contribution or remained stagnant.

Hence, Organic Searches are an essential driver of brand awareness. The B2B Marketplace must invest in Search Engine Optimisation to drive organic traffic and experience a Top of the funnel growth (Brand Awareness).

Let us investigate which channels are crucial for maintaining the brand awareness for the marketplace.

Insights: There are major channels that maintain brand awareness:
1) Organic Search

2) Paid search

3) Social Media marketing

Out of the 3, organic traffic drives growth in Brand awareness, as discussed previously.


#### 4) Landing pages:

- 495 Landing pages were developed out of which 58(11.7%) Landing pages bring in 80% of the leads.

- 'b76ef37428e6799c421989521c0e5077' and '22c29808c4f815213303f8933030604c' bring in significantly more leads than the others.

- The goal is to replicate the success of the above two landing pages. This can be done efficiently through further experimentation via A/B testing.
